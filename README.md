# EagleCadLibraries


This is my collection of Libaries.
I made a Python script that can create Libraries from values written in a TXT file 
Until now only RC0402 and RC0603 is created but in the future CC0402 and CC0603 will be created too
I used my own modified version of the Yageo_By_element14_Batch_1 Library but because i pretty much only use 0603 and a bit of 0402 i got tired of all the waste in the library and different tolerances so i created a script which can create libraries when you got a list of components 
I limited it to E24 but it can easily be expanded to E48
Script will also be available. Note that there are different scrips for Capacitors and Resistors just to keep it simple
